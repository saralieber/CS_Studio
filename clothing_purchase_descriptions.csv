A grey medium Nike sweatshirt from Dick's sporting goods.
"I go thrifting often. I find second hand clothing to give me greater joy than expensive clothing at stores. I also enjoy owning nice high dollar clothing so the only way I can wear such clothing is if it's second hand. My most recent clothing purchase was at Buffalo Exchange when I found the cutest pair of army green Lululemon shorts. These shorts were a medium and I typically wear a small, but they have drawstrings so they work perfectly. They are a moderate length, stretchy fabric, light weight, with the ability to be dressed up or dressed down.

"The last clothing item I purchased was a pair of off-white chunky tennis shoes. I purchased them two weeks ago online after wanting them for over a year. They were expensive but I saved up for them and knew I wanted them. They are trendy but also something that will last for a long time and not go out of style because they are for working out. They are extremely comfortable. They are not true white and have cream and grey undertones, I believe the color is called ""cloud"". The sole of the shoe is thick and curved, which gives them a very chunky look and makes me look taller. At the toe, the shoes are wider than near the heel. There are grey-ish fractal patterns on the top of the shoe that holds the mesh that allows the shoe to be breathable and athletic. On the back of the shoe, there is a small tab that makes them easier to put on. The laces are white with grey stripes. They also came with rainbow laces."

"I finished making my denim jacket sometime in December. It's a little big on me, with brown and orange floral threads on the lower and upper front parts because I bought it used before I sewed stuff on it. The denim is blue and the jacket overall is covered in patches, including a couple mermaid ones, lots of ones with sequins and glitter, a ""Star Trek: The Original Series"" patch, various cat-themed patches, and so on. Except for a few they were all sewn on by hand and I did that all by myself. The back has a particularly large patch of a tiger head on it, with lots of rhinestones attached to it. Beneath the tiger head are two laurels with dangling pink beads hanging off of them, and beneath those laurels, centered in the very center of the back of the jacket, is a sequin blue, black, and white evil eye patch. There are also birds symmetrically centered around the tiger head and other patches on the back. The arms each have two beaded and sequin patches my mom made over a decade ago that I'd been saving for some use; the patches are all put on the elbows to serve as fancypants elbow pads. The cuffs of each arm have thin and/or small patches sewn into them, one of which on one arm is a planet with rings around it in the trans pride colors. Up the arm are some other patches, especially on the shoulder; I can't remember which shoulder it is, but that's where the ""Star Trek"" patch is located. Then there's patches sewn over the brown and orange threaded parts on the front, though you can still see the thread pretty easily because none of the patches were large enough to cover them. Covering an upper threaded part is a full-body tiger patch (this patch is one of the few I didn't sew on by hand but instead borrowed my mom's sewing machine) with various small paw print patches around it. Covering a lower threaded part is a fuzzy black-and-white patch that reads ""MEOW,"" with the O being represented by a cartoony eyeless cat head done with thread. The patch is very soft and s"

"I currently am on a shopping spree, however the last thing I bought out of everything was a blue and white plaid skirt. The skirt length was about 3 inches above my knee and the waistband sat right above my hips. The skirt was not flowy what so over but was not a bodycon so it was not shaped to my body tightly. There is a slit on the right side that made a triangle shape where the point landed about and inch and a half into the skirt. The plaid print was of a baby blue color and was quite large but not too big the squares could've been about an inch by and inch. The fabric did not appear transparent but was thin so that I could wear it comfortably in hot weather."
