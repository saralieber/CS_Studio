I working on the depression with a therapist meds and podcasts. When I'm feeling crappy and chubby and I start shopping and I go to choose a size I talk myself out of it because I will be loosing weight this year.\", 'I shop when I need a “treat” and I also get a little dopamine hit from finding a good deal.', 'One of the best pieces of advice I ever got on this subject was about hair. The advice was, \"do you want her haircut, or do you actually just want her face?\" It fundamentally changed the way I approached haircuts. No, it turns out I don\\'t want bangs; I want to be a hot, gamine 20-year-old Ukrainian model. I\\'m not, and bangs look like garbage on me. I\\'m also way too lazy and they give me forehead acne.\\n\\nI\\'ve since extrapolated that advice to apply to clothing. Do I really want this piece of clothing, or do I want the body it looks good on? Taking it even further: Do I really want new clothes, or do I want to be *a new person?*\\n\\nTo some extent it\\'s obviously appropriate to remodel your wardrobe to reflect who you feel you are - that\\'s why most of us are here, after all. Self-expression is important, and sometimes it\\'s pragmatically necessary too; like, I look like a child, and so it\\'s been important for my professional career to dress way more severely. But a lot of the time, I\\'m actually shopping because something\\'s wrong and I\\'m trying to fill that void.\\n\\nMost of the time the thing that is wrong relates to how I\\'m feeling about myself. I want to be a new person, and in my mind, a fresh piece of clothing feels like it will let me play a role: someone who isn\\'t me, but rather, who\\'s better. Spoiler: it won\\'t. Anywhere you go, there you are. I do love my new, extremely pointy faux crocodile skin boots, but I\\'m still an anxious wreck inside. Shopping will not fix this.', \"I shop when I'm anticipating something but can't *do* anything else to prepare for it. My SO and I started wedding planning, but haven't actually gotten engaged yet, so I'm all over looking for bargain-but-beautiful bridesmaid dresses, outfits for a honeymoon, etc. I have two trips abroad coming up this year, the flights are booked and everything is planned so the only thing I have left to hype myself up with is a couple new pieces for the trips, right? When I get in a rut at work I reinvent my work look, I went on a midi skirt tear a few months ago. Things like that.\\n\\nGranted, I've gotten better about allowing myself to online window shop but not actually purchase, and that really helps satisfy my need for the hunt without being wasteful of money and resources.\", 'Not sure if this makes sense, but I feel like shopping (& finding a piece I really like) gives me a little high that’s totally separate from whatever else is going on in my life. I can still smile when I think about my new sweater even if I’ve got a mile-long to do list, I’m arguing with my SO, or my pup’s sick.\\n\\nWriting this out, I’m wondering if there are other little “wins” I can look for to take the place of shopping/finding that new thing, like maybe an artistic outlet where I can *make* rather than *buy.*', \"When I'm trying to distract myself from having emotions with the thought of not being good enough. I think that if I could just make myself look as great as possible, maybe everyone will like me and everything will be ok.\", 'My shopping is often aspirational. \"If I own those North Face pants, i\\'ll be the type of person who goes hiking more.\" \"Once I have that structured sheath dress, I\\'ll automatically be more responsible and adult-like at work.\"', 'I grew up as a shopaholic.  That type of behavior was normalized (cue most teen movies of the era having the mall as the be all end all hangout) and my stepgrandmother was addicted to shopping.  Once I started working, my paychecks were spent on clothes, accessories, etc.  \\n\\nFor the last few years, I\\'m going \\'gradual minimalist\\' and slowly shrinking how many items I own.  For 2020, I am aiming for 10 or fewer clothing items coming in that are not a direct replacement for something worn out (ie replacing a ratty black shirt with a different black shirt).  (I\\'ll never do the whole capsule wardrobe thing as I\\'m the type of person that would rather have more clothes and do laundry less often.)   I was initially going to do no buy but realize that sometimes I want to buy a shirt from an event (or similar) so I left that option open.  (I still do have a $50/month budget for clothing/shoes/accessories that can carry over if I don\\'t use it one month)\\n\\nFrom 1/15-3/15 I am on a total financial diet (started late to take advantage of post holiday sales).  I ended up buying a clearance sweater to replace a worn out one before the diet started.  (I can only spend money on groceries, transportation, and bills).   My prior habits tend to have me being good in some categories while going overboard in others.  In 2017-2018 this was pink yarn (I make/sell Women\\'s March hats).  In 2019, I didn\\'t buy any pink yarn (still using up my stash) but the shopping bug transferred to makeup (to the point where I expanded my storage system).  This diet isn\\'t allowing me to buy ANY pink yarn or makeup in this time period and is trying to shift my habits.\\n\\nEven though I\\'m lasering in on the \"personal care\" category (thanks r/MakeupRehab), I\\'m also focusing secondarily on clothing and reducing numbers (one pair of socks will be put in my H&M clothing recycling bag after I wash them as they\\'re holey).  My end goal is to have at least twice as many items go out than in in 2020.  My dresser/closet is quite full and unlike my acrylic makeup organizer, I can\\'t easily buy another piece that will neatly stack into it.', \"After medical appointments, mostly. My self-control is pretty effective until I'm feeling low after seeing the Doctor, even if there's no bad news. it's just the process of psyching myself up for it and then having to go back to work, I always want to soften the blow with a visit to the shops.\", 'I recently moved to a new area and left all of my friends behind. I shop because it feels good to get out of the house and it’s one of the few things that you can do  alone without getting pitying looks from people. I would love to make friends in the area so that I would have other reasons to leave the house instead of shopping alone but honestly have no idea how to make friends as an adult who is no longer meeting people at school.', 'When I’m bored (at work) I browse, something inevitably catches my eye. I now have a rule that I have to think about it for at least a few weeks before I am allowed to buy it. If I forget about it, then I didn’t really need it. Similarly, the piece has to be versatile, i.e. be appropriate for at least 2-3 different things. And it needs to match with something already in my wardrobe. The week before my period, all hell breaks loose and I don’t stick to my own rules. Last month, I bought 14 table runners and 3 table clothes “for when we entertain a lot of people” (we never do). This month, I bought 3 dresses on EBay that were a good deal, but that definitely don’t fill a hole in my closet. They did, however, fill a hole in my Gal Meets Glam-loving heart', 'For me I start to shop when I’m bored cause there’s no harm in looking right? (wrong) \\n\\nAlso, seeing good sales that pop up in my email. \\n\\nWhat I think about to prevent purchases,  is the fact it took 2 days to konmari my closet and how I don’t want to go through that again. \\n\\nThen I look at the item and think about the quality / trendiness. Like, will I wear this in 2 months? Will it last x amount of time? \\n\\nAlso, used an app called unroll me to unsub from all store emails to avoid getting tempted by sales.', \"I shop when I don't want to go home.\\n\\nIt's thrift to resell, or personal items that need replacing, recently a big maternity store is going out of business and I'm broody. It's bizarre, I know, but if I'm lucky enough to fall pregnant I won't be able to borrow much from friends. Who doesn't want expensive, happy, stretchy pretties for 80% off?\\n\\nI spend a lot of time wandering grocery stores (I love them). I browse forever in the produce section, discover neat treats like star apples. Read all of the nutrition labels and do our meal maths mentally. I eat low sodium, but honestly I have it all memorized by now. \\n\\nI do our heavy linen loads at the laundromat, partially to be able to wash all of the comforters, towels, sheets, etc at once, but also not to shop.\", \"I shop when I'm sad. Things have been very hard recently so I feel like I go shopping more or online shop nowadays way more than I used to. \\nI'm not making much progress in terms of dealing with it, but I erased all my saved credit cards from my web browser so I have to actually get up and look around for it lol\", 'God, I don\\'t know if anyone else feels like this, but sometimes, I just get hit with the \"I want to shop right now.\" I\\'ve been through the Konmari phase. I\\'ve tried getting rid of a lot of stuff. That stopped me from shopping for a while, but sometimes, after you watch a \"thrift with me video\", I die.\\n\\nBut luckily, I\\'ve slapped myself out of it for a while. I look online, add stuff to my cart, and never buy it. I try to organize my own clothing, and that is really the stopper. Goal is to have less than 50 pieces of clothes, but it\\'s hard. T_T', 'I shop when I\\'m bored and want to get out of the house/interact with people. I\\'m trying to find other hobbies that I can just \"drop in\" and mini-socialize. Its hard though!\\n\\nAnd I shop when I feel bad about my body. I don\\'t always love it, but I sometimes feel like fashion is the way I\\'ll feel confident?', 'I shop because I finally feel really good. This last year I got a promotion, lost some weight, went from always dying my hair dark to a lighter color that really suits me. I started finding outfits/looks that make me feel so confident and good about myself, and I get stuck in a cycle of wanting to keep it up. It’s so good to feel good, but at what price?', 'This sub has actually really helped me with low/no shopping so far this year. It started with me cleaning out my closet and realizing... I hated about 80% of my clothes. The funny thing is, I\\'m quite good at styling and I can help style my friends and family easily. It\\'s ME I have major trouble styling ::facepalm::\\n\\nI decided to find my personal style this year - I figured out my season, and I\\'ve been reading the book Anuschka Rees \"Curated Closet\" which has helped me - it takes things step by step. I\\'m on the inspiration step - taking pictures of your daily outfits, curating inspiration boards, defining my style with keywords. I decided I\\'m not buying anything until I figure this out. \\n\\nWhenever I do start to purchase again, I\\'m going to do that \"5 items per season\" rule - only because I\\'m terrified of filling up my closet with clothes that make me feel terrible all over again. I realized it\\'s been about 15 years of shopping whenever I please and I really don\\'t want to be like that anymore. It\\'s going to take time to get rid of the itch but I\\'m happy with the progress I\\'ve made so far.', 'I shop when I see deal or sales and feel the need to buy have and store. Something I’m trying to break out of.', \"I shop when there's a good sale, or when I'm bored at work. I also tend to overbuy for vacations. For some reason when I go out of town, I feel I need to buy totally new clothes to take with me as I like to carefully curate outfits while on vacation and look cute for pictures. Sometimes I just feel like I need to treat myself, and I feel like I'm in the mood to spend money. These are all very destructive habits and I just constantly have to ask myself if I really need an item and if I'm really going to wear it.\", 'So I shop when I need a dopamine hit. I go to school in a major city and whenever I’m bored studying or something is stressing me out, I get the urge to go buy myself something to feel better. I’m trying to not do this as much and focus my energy on creative outlets to relax like drawing and writing which has worked out pretty well. Since January 1st, I’ve purchased a pair of jeans, 2 bodysuits to wear on my birthday weekend, and a pair of pants which is actually a big improvement for me.', 'I’m actually addicted to shopping. And I know I am. Once a month or so I just “need” to buy things. And not just one or two shirts because that’s “not worth it”. I need a whole haul. I imagine the outfits I can make with the new clothes and it makes me happy and excited. It’s gotten to the point that I have so many clothes I don’t even realize what I own. I have lots of unworn clothes too because I sometimes buy things that will only work for very specific occasions. \\nBut nothing beats that high of a new purchase. It makes me feel great. Especially with online shopping because I get a second high when the clothes actually arrive. But then that high goes away eventually. And I need another fix. \\nI know all this about myself, and my once a month spending is a huge improvement from my once every week I was spending before.

I’ve been trying to clean my closets instead and it’s been working some of the time.', 'This is a great topic! I have been recently struggling with my own bad buying habits. I have more recently been trying to work towards overcoming this very thing.   \\nWhat caused me to shop was seeing a really cute outfit, whether it be on someone I knew or online at one of my favourite stores and having this feeling of \"I have to have it\". Browsing online when I\\'m bored is also a huge one for me as it leads me to discover things that I think I needed/ want. \\n\\n  \\nAfter realizing the perils in online shopping/browsing. I\\'ve made some rules with myself that I have to wait a certain amount of time before purchasing any item. usually a 2-3 window and beyond to really make sure that I am actually interested in the item and it\\'s not an impulse buy. I also like to live by the rule that anything new coming into the closet, something ought to leave (as this also helps with not having to purchase more hangers and whatnot) I also unsubscribed from all my favorite stores, and don\\'t follow them on Instagram, so that I am not seeing new styles and outfit pieces that may trigger me to want something.', 'For me, it\\'s the thrill of the hunt. I love trying to find outrageous bang for you buck deals, but then I later realize the money probably could have been better spent on a larger purchase, or put towards something like a vacation.\\n\\nThe other reason I think I shop is because it feels like a sort of advancement of myself. By coalescing my wardrobe into a more \"fashionable\" state, it feels like I\\'m accomplishing something. This probably stems from the fact that I find my job to be fairly unfulfilling so I find solace in consumerism. Milestones in the middle of life are few and far between. It feels like an almost endless void between where I am now in my career and retirement, so fashion fills the gap and gives me something to work towards in a more immediate timeline.\\n\\nAt the end of the day I should really scale back because my closets are full and I don\\'t \"need\" anything else.', \"I shop when I'm feeling discontent with my life and antsy for change.

I'm not good at creating outfits that fit specific events (or I'm just too picky about it, idk) so I always feel over or underdressed, unless I've specifically shopped with that occasion in mind. Of course, this doesn't help when it's really uncertainty and anxiety that makes me feel underconfident, and the outfit is just an expensive way to feel reassured.\", 'I shop when I\\'m bored, sometimes as a \"fun bonding activity\" with a friend, and really feel the itch when I have an event coming up (even if it\\'s something small like anticipating a karaoke night on a weekend with friends).

But I don’t want to spend money on bras! Maybe I’m also just picky. But I tend to shop when I feel happy and confident about myself, and have extra money.', \"For me it's a combination of mindset and physical opportunity. Most of my shopping happens when I get off work and I'm feeling stressed out or sad, and I pass by a thrift store on my way home. My impulse control is lowered by the stress of work and I want to celebrate my freedom by chilling out for a while just looking at clothes by myself. Since I committed to no shopping this year, I've been making an effort to walk on the other side of the street from the thrift store, and I think that little bit of extra distance has helped me resist the impulse to go inside.\", 'I haven’t really been buying things on impulse anymore but I’ve been buying clothes cause I feel like I need it. Especially when there’s a sale, and it’s an item that I really want but never wanted to buy on full price. I just stopped subscribing to stores’ emails so I wouldn’t know if they have sales or not.', 'I have two main shopping occasions.\\n\\nThe first is social.  I hang out with a friend.  We have coffee and egg each other on.  We laugh, giggle and occasionally squeal at finding the perfect item.  We spend too much money but it is glorious social bonding fun.  These are the occasions when I find clothes that are not ‘needed’ and tend to be more frivolous.\\n\\nThe other occasion is when i specifically need an item.  Then I go online and try a few different favourite sites until I find something. I’m much more picky about these items and will not buy unless it’s perfect.\\n\\nSo the first occasion is clearly where I need to focus if I want to cut down!', 'I shop when I’m lonely and I can’t get any of my friends to leave the house. Shopping is something you can always do alone. It feels less stupid than going to a museum or coffeehouse or something by yourself.

And I\\'ll likely just get it.\\n\\nI shop when I feel like the items I have aren\\'t presenting what I\\'d like to present at the moment. Right now I am trying to figure out solid colors, as a step to a slightly smaller wardrobe. But I don\\'t really like solids or things that feel too plain. But they are more versatile than my arsenal of printed stuff. \\n\\nI shop when I am a little bored and I need inspiration. I love window shopping. I always have. Usually I don\\'t buy anything other than a snack or a magazine. \\n\\nI am also so Bridget Jones. When I want to start a new hobby or whatever, I feel like I need to shop to kickstart the mood. E.g. \"I am trying to cook at home more, so I need good containers to store my leftovers in. Oh is that pan a really great color? When was the last time I bought a pan?\" \\n\\nI am working on reorganizing and redecorating may apartment. I went a little crazy at the container store.\\n\\nAnd another thing that triggers shopping for me, sales of course. I am trying to moderate this impulse in 2 ways. One I have basically unsubscribed from a lot of emails for the mass brands, that are readily always in budget. Instead I am only on the mailing list for aspirational brands. Brands that I really need a 70% discount for to afford. This works really well for me, but cause I won\\'t really buy at full price.  Or if I did I would have needed to save, and wanted it for a while and so on. Today that happened. A jacket I have been wanting for 4-6 months suddenly went on sale for 70% off. Sold. Hopefully it is a lovely as my brain has hyped it up to be. It suits the sort of mood I have been with my clothing. And I tried a similar piece and it didn\\'t fit well. Hopefully this version nailed the details. \\n\\nAnyway, I am trying to get better at the shopping thing, and use what I have. And this year I am focused.  Last year was one of my best shopping years, but I went crazy at the end of the year, because some of the things on my list popped up, and the trends suit me well in some ways. This year I want to persevere.', 'Stress.

Being on an insomniac streak and in my sleep-deprived state, it was easier to justify spending 80 Euro on a tote bag than 250. So I went from having healthy January savings to getting through that AND half my February income by the tenth of this month.\\n\\nI decided to go on a no-buy and told this to a few people so I could be held to that.

I didn't buy a ton last spring, so the styles are somewhat different than what I currently have in my closet.  In the past I might buy some things now in spring preparation, although I won't be getting warm weather until April.  But I am going to try to wait to buy anything until the weather changes, I assess my existing spring/summer clothing, and I can determine if I would wear a purchase immediately.  I'm also more tempted to buy new for spring summer.  Thrifting for sweaters is relatively easy, but I don't always have as much luck with warm weather clothes where the fit can be more specific.  But I am going to try to limit myself to 3-4 new pieces for the season max.  And maybe another 5-6 thrifted pieces.
