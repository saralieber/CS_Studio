Needed it for a friends sorority formal. I don't have formal wear and am too tall to borrow from friends. ,2
"I got the jacket because I didn't have one and being from Southern California, I don't really have any heavy duty rain jacket because the weather doesn't really call for one.

"It was a gift from my sister to celebrate getting accepted to the U of O. She gave me a U of O shirt.
I feel like it's hard to answer this survey using a gift as an example. To get at some of the ideas you're asking about. I don't generally buy Nike brand and I don't generally buy clothing with writing on it because I'm not a billboard and I don't want to use my body to promote brands or ideas. I will wear logos for organizations I volunteer with. I don't buy a lot of clothes because I don't want to spend money on clothes and because it's terrible for the environment although I'm not very responsible when I do purchase clothes I will often choose cheap over responsibly source. I try to make up for it buy wearing them until they are literally falling apart. All that said, if my sister hadn't given me a U of O shirt I probably would have bought one myself because supporting the local sports team is a quick way a signalling that you're part of the in-group. I move often and I always support the local team because it's a short cut to social inclusion.",2
